# 🧠 PLS4MIS: Partially Labeled Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation

**PLS4MIS** is an open-source toolbox for **partially labeled medical image segmentation**.

* This project aims to facilitate research in scenarios where full pixel-wise annotations are expensive or infeasible by providing literature reviews, benchmark implementations, and practical PyTorch code.
